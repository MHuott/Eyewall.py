# Eyewall.py
This is an undergraduate research project with Cadet Huott working under the direction and supervision of Dr. Williams of The Citadel Physics Department.  This computational physics research is looking into eyewall replacment cycles.  We are doing that using research from the CMISS Tropical Cyclones Group satelitte data.  All satelitte data is publicly available through this website link:  https://tropic.ssec.wisc.edu/.  If you use any of our programs or datasets, please reach out and give us feedback.  Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy using these python programs.

For any questions or comments, reach out to mhuott@citadel.edu or The Citadel Physics Department.
